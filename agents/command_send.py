HANDOFFS PATTERN (LangChain Multi-Agent)

This implements the "Handoffs" pattern from LangChain's multi-agent documentation:
https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent.md#handoffs

In handoffs, agents can directly pass control to each other. The "active" agent changes, 
and the user interacts with whichever agent currently has control.

Flow:
1. The current agent decides it needs help from another agent
2. It passes control (and state) to the next agent  
3. The new agent interacts directly with the user until it decides to hand off again or finish

This implementation uses Command + Send objects for advanced handoff control:
- Uses structured output (Pydantic models) for routing decisions
- Command + Send pattern allows passing custom state to different agents
- More explicit control over what data each agent receives

Key characteristics:
- Decentralized control: agents can change who is active
- Agents can interact directly with the user
- Complex, human-like conversation between specialists
- **MAIN BENEFIT: Control context sent to agents** - agents receive only focused context instead of full conversation history

Benefits:
- Agents interact directly with users
- Support for complex, multi-domain conversations
- Specialist takeover capabilities
- Flexible state management per agent
- Structured decision making for routing

When to use (from LangChain docs):
- Need centralized control over workflow? ❌ No
- Want agents to interact directly with the user? ✅ Yes
- Complex, human-like conversation between specialists? ✅ Strong

Perfect for: Multi-domain conversations, specialist takeover, complex agent interactions

Your primary role is to serve as a supervisor/planner for this multi-agent team that helps answer queries from customers, and generate the next agent to route to. 

Your team is composed of two subagents that you can use to help answer the customer's request:
1. music_catalog_subagent: this subagent has access to user's saved music preferences. It can also retrieve information about the digital music store's music 
catalog (albums, tracks, songs, etc.) from the database. 
2. invoice_information_subagent: this subagent is able to retrieve information about a customer's past purchases or invoices 
from the database. 

Based on the existing steps that have been taken in the messages, your role is to generate the next subagent that needs to be called as well as the context they need to answer user queries. 
This could be one step in an inquiry that needs multiple sub-agent calls. 
If subagents are no longer needed to answer the user question or if a question is unrelated to music or invoice, return END.

    HANDOFFS PATTERN: Supervisor that decides which agent should have control.
    
    From LangChain docs: "The current agent decides to transfer control to another agent. 
    The active agent changes, and the user may continue interacting directly with the new agent."
    
    This demonstrates the Command + Send pattern for handoffs where:
    1. Current agent (supervisor) decides it needs help from another agent
    2. It passes control (and state) to the next agent using Command + Send
    3. The new agent will interact directly with the user until handoff or finish
    4. Different agents can receive different input data for focused context
    
    KEY BENEFIT: Instead of passing the full conversation history to agents,
    Send allows us to pass only the specific context each agent needs (result.context).
    This enables decentralized control where agents can change who is active.
